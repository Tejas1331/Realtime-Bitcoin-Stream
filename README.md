## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is designed to:
- **Ingest** live Bitcoin price data using Kafka.
- **Predict** future Bitcoin prices using a machine learning model (predicting t+2 minute prices).
- **Stream** the data using Apache Spark (Batch or Structured Streaming).
- **Visualize** live data and predictions in a Streamlit dashboard.
- **Track** Buy/Sell signals and profit/loss calculations.
- **Log** results and data into Google Sheets for persistence and monitoring.
